## Hi there 👋

I'm [Jan Škoruba](https://skoruba.com). I am working on open source projects primary related to identity and access control. 

I am very interested in [@openid](https://github.com/openin) 🔒 • [@dotnet](https://github.com/dotnet)🚀 • [@reactjs](https://github.com/reactjs) ⚛

It makes me so happy to see that my projects interest someone else and together we are building something useful.
